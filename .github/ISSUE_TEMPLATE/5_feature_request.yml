          Before requesting a new feature, make sure it hasn't been
          [requested yet](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/labels/meta%3Afeature-request),
          and isn't already supported by [mpv](https://mpv.io/manual/master/),
          [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/documentation.html), or existing
          [mpv scripts](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/wiki/User-Scripts).


          If you are not sure about this, ask on
          [mpv Discussions](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/discussions) and
          [mpv IRC channel](https://mpv.io/community/) first before opening a feature request.

          Even if you think it's not necessary at first, it might help us later to find
          possible issues. Make a log file with `--log-file=output.txt`, which is our preferred way,
          and attach it to the issue.


          If you have trouble producing a log file, you can alternatively use `-v -v`, save the
          terminal output to a file, and attach it to the issue.

          Please provide sample files in the case you request a format/codec/container dependent
          feature, and it could help us test and implement it.


          Preferably files should be attached directly within the text field below. Due to GitHub's
          upload restriction, you may need to archive the sample file first and upload it as `.zip`
          file. If the sample file is too big to attach directly, use a solution that is easy to
          access with possible long-term retention. Possible services include, but are not limited
          to, the following:

          - [0x0.st](https://0x0.st/) (no long-term retention)
